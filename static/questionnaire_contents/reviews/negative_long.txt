I was disappointed with this smartphone. The overall performance leaves much to be desired. The most frustrating part is the battery life—on a typical day, I find myself needing to charge it twice, which is incredibly inconvenient. Additionally, the phone overheats during extended use, especially while gaming or streaming. To top it off, the screen arrived with a small scratch, which was disappointing for a brand-new device. Overall, it doesn’t live up to the expectations for the price point.
